## What is FlowAuto?

FlowAuto is a **visual node-based automation engine** that lets you build complex desktop automation workflows by dragging and connecting logic nodes. It combines image recognition, OCR, color tracking, window control, and keyboard/mouse simulation into a single GUI tool.

### How It Works

1. **Design** your automation flow on a visual canvas — drag nodes from the toolbox and connect them
2. **Configure** each node's parameters in the property panel (windows, coordinates, images, colors, keys)
3. **Run** the flow — the engine executes nodes sequentially, following the connections
4. **Monitor** execution through a real-time log panel

Flows are saved as JSON files and can be edited or shared.

## Use Cases

| Scenario                         | How FlowAuto Helps                                                                       |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Game automation**        | Auto-launch → wait for loading → image-click UI → press keys in a loop                |
| **Desktop app automation** | Launch app → wait for window → click buttons → fill forms                             |
| **UI monitoring**          | Detect color/state changes on screen, trigger actions when conditions change             |
| **Visual tracking**        | Track colored objects on screen, detect movement direction, auto-control via key presses |
| **Multi-condition logic**  | Combine multiple visual conditions with AND/OR logic for complex decision making         |

## Node Types

FlowAuto provides **9 logic nodes**, each serving a distinct purpose in the automation pipeline.

### `StartProgram` — Launch External Programs

- **What it does**: Starts an executable, waits for its window to appear, stores the window handle for downstream nodes.
- **Use when**: You need to launch a game, tool, or any program as the first step of your flow.
- **Key features**: Supports admin mode, custom arguments, window keyword matching.

### `ClickElement` — Locate & Click UI Elements

- **What it does**: Finds and clicks a target position in a window using three modes: **Coordinate**, **TemplateMatch**, or **OCR**.
- **Use when**: You need to click buttons, menus, or any UI element.
- **Key features**: Multi-scale template matching (0.5x–1.5x), configurable pre/post-click delays.

### `WaitCondition` — Wait for a Condition

- **What it does**: Blocks execution until a condition is met. Supports 5 types: **ImageAppear**, **ImageDisappear**, **OCRContain**, **WindowExist**, **Timeout**.
- **Use when**: You need to wait for a loading screen to finish, a dialog to appear, or a fixed delay before the next step.
- **Key features**: Configurable check interval, timeout, and retry logic.

### `KeyPress` — Send Keyboard Input

- **What it does**: Sends hardware scan code keystrokes to the target window. Supports Press, Hold, and Release modes.
- **Use when**: You need to press keys (letters, function keys, ESC, SPACE, etc.) in a target window.
- **Key features**: Built-in scan code table, hold duration control, window activation.

### `Loop` — Repeat Child Nodes

- **What it does**: Executes connected child nodes in a loop. Two modes: **FixedCount** (repeat N times) or **BreakCondition** (loop until a break signal is received).
- **Use when**: You need to repeat actions, monitor continuously, or run until a condition is met.
- **Key features**: BreakCondition mode has a built-in white input port on the left — connect a Condition's True output to exit the loop. No separate Break node needed.

### `Condition` — Conditional Branching

- **What it does**: Checks a condition once and routes execution to **True** or **False** branch. Supports **ImageAppear** (template match) and **OCRContain** (text detection).
- **Use when**: You need to make a decision based on what appears on screen.
- **Key features**: Instant snapshot check (not polling), full-screen or region-based.

### `Gate` — Logic Gate (2-Input, 1-Output)

- **What it does**: Receives two upstream signals, performs a logical operation (**AND** / **OR** / **NOT**), and produces a single result for downstream nodes.
- **Use when**: You need to combine multiple conditions. Example: two ColorMotion nodes detecting different directions → Gate(AND) = diagonal movement detected.
- **Key features**: Two input ports (0, 1), one result output port.

### `ColorMotion` — Color Visual Monitoring

- **What it does**: Independent color tracking and motion analysis node with three modes:
  - **MotionDetect**: Is a target color moving? → True/False
  - **StateChange**: Has the color at a fixed position changed? → True/False
  - **DirectionDetect**: Which direction is the target moving? → 5 output ports (Up, Down, Left, Right, Stationary)
- **Use when**: You need to track colored objects on screen, detect UI state changes, or drive directional control.
- **Key features**: HSV color filtering, template matching reference, configurable frame intervals. Diagonal detection via two ColorMotion nodes + Gate(AND).

### `ColorCal` — Multi-Target Color Computation

- **What it does**: Defines multiple independent detection targets (each with its own HSV/template config), batch-identifies them, then evaluates a **C# expression** based on the targets' pixel coordinates. The integer result routes to the matching output port.
- **Use when**: You need complex positional logic. Example: `Target1.Found ? (Target1.X > Target2.X ? 0 : 1) : 2` — route to different branches based on relative positions of two targets.
- **Key features**: Expression variables (`{Name}.X`, `{Name}.Y`, `{Name}.Found`), configurable successor count, dynamic output ports.

## Quick Start

### For End Users (Download & Run)

1. Download the latest `FlowAuto` release package from the [Releases]() page
2. Extract the archive to any folder
3. Run `FlowAuto.exe`

> **No .NET runtime or OpenCV installation needed** — everything is bundled in the self-contained package.

### Prerequisites (for End Users)

- **Windows 10/11 (x64)**
- **Visual C++ Redistributable (x64)** — [Download](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe) *(usually pre-installed on most systems)*

### Build from Source (for Developers)

```powershell
# Clone the repository
cd FlowAuto

# Publish self-contained (no .NET SDK needed on target machine)
dotnet publish FlowAuto\FlowAuto.csproj --configuration Release -o "..\publish" --self-contained true

# The output is in the publish folder — copy the entire folder to any Windows x64 machine and run:
.\FlowAuto.exe
```

> **Administrator privileges required** — the application uses a manifest to request elevation. Keyboard/mouse simulation and window control require admin rights.
